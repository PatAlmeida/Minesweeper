A minesweeper game made in the browser using JavaScript and p5.js. 
In order to run the code, it must be launched from the p5.js editor. I have included this in the editor directory. I do not own any of that, it belongs entirely to the Processing Foundation: https://processingfoundation.org/
I have included a video of me playing the game in the demos directory.
