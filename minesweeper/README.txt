A minesweeper game made in the browser using JavaScript and p5.js. 
In order to run the code, it must be launched from the p5.js editor. I have included this in the editor directory. I do not own any of the editor, it belongs entirely to the Processing Foundation: https://processingfoundation.org/
The minesweeper code, however, is all my own.
I have included a video of me playing the game in the demos directory.
